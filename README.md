# bubbles
Animated bubbles bouncing around the window, using p5.js

## todo
- [] Instead of changing followMouse boolean to make the bubbles follow the
     cursor, just change followFactor to 0 (see next item)
- [] Create slider in menu pane to adjust followFactor, allowing negative values
     so that bubbles run away from cursor
- [] Make menu pane draggable around the window
- [] Make colors of bubbles adjustable, or change based on time of day
- [] Make background color change based on time of day
