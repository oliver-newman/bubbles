# bubbles
Animated bubbles bouncing around the window, using p5.js

## todo
- [ ] Instead of changing followMouse boolean to make the bubbles follow the
      cursor, just change followFactor to 0 (see next item)
- [ ] Create slider in menu pane to adjust followFactor, allowing negative values
      so that bubbles run away from cursor
- [ ] Make menu pane draggable around the window
- [ ] Make rgb colors of bubbles adjustable using 3 slider bars
